;; Fuzzy finder app integration into Emacs.

;; `fuzzy-finder' command starts a fuzzy finder process and calls a function
;; on the selected items.
;; By default it visits selected files.

;; There are a number of applications which can be used with `fuzzy-finder'
;; such as fzf (default), peco, and selecta.

;; You can customize default values used for `fuzzy-finder' execution:
;; fuzzy finder command, input command, action function and so on.
;; These values can also be given when calling `fuzzy-finder' as a function,
;; which is useful when you want to define new interactive commands that uses
;; `fuzzy-finder'.

Open a term buffer and start fuzzy-finder process using ARGUMENTS.
After the process exits successfully call ACTION function with selected items.

All arguments are optional keyword arguments.
There is a variable that defines default value for each argument except for
DIRECTORY. For example, `fuzzy-finder-default-arguments' for the ARGUMENTS key.

`:directory DIRECTORY'
    Set the directory to start fuzzy-finder application from.
    If not given current `default-directory' will be used.

`:arguments ARGUMENTS'
    Command line arguments to be passed to `fuzzy-finder-executable'.

`:input-command INPUT-COMMAND'
    When non-empty string is given for INPUT-COMMAND, the stdout of this
    command result will be piped (\"|\") into COMMAND.
    Otherwise, COMMAND will be invoked without any input, thus the application
    default might be used (\"FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND\" for example).

`:action ACTION'
    Callback function that results of fuzzy-finder selection will be passed to.

    This function shall accept one argument RESULTS.
    RESULTS is a list of string of fuzzy-finder selection: it will be made by
    splitting stdout of command by OUTPUT-DELIMITER.

`:output-delimiter OUTPUT-DELIMITER'
    Regular expression to split the command output.
    When the stdout is delimited by ASCII NUL characters, this value should be
    \"\\0\".

`:window-height WINDOW-HEIGHT'
    Interger height of window that displays fuzzy-finder buffer."
